/* Configuration ************************************************************/
/* CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
 *   handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
 *   is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
 *   can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
 *   garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations
 *   from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
 *   then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
 *   (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
 *   if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE
 *   is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
 * CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORK - Build the high priority work queue. To preserve
 *   legacy behavior, CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORK is assumed to be true in a flat
 *   build (CONFIG_SCHED_KERNEL=n) but must be defined in kernel mode
 *   in order to build the high priority work queue.
 * CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the worker
 *   thread.  Default: 192
 * CONFIG_SCHED_WORKPERIOD - How often the worker thread checks for
 *   work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).
 * CONFIG_SCHED_WORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the worker
 *   thread.  Default: CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
 * CONFIG_SIG_SIGWORK - The signal number that will be used to wake-up
 *   the worker thread.  Default: 17
 *
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORK. If CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE is defined, then a single
 *   work queue is created by default.  If CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORK is also defined
 *   then an additional, lower-priority work queue will also be created.  This
 *   lower priority work queue is better suited for more extended processing
 *   (such as file system clean-up operations)
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the lower priority
 *   worker thread.  Default: 50
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKPERIOD - How often the lower priority worker thread
 *  checks for work in units of microseconds.  Default: 50*1000 (50 MS).
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the lower
 *   priority worker thread.  Default: CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
